write a function that takes two dates and returns an integer that represents the number 
of days between dates, so that the program outputs the number of days. [DONE]
-----------
allow user to select between available saved dates (assignment due dates, quiz dates, 
and final dates) or enter their own date [DONE]
-----------
when inputting a custom date, allow user input of the format MM/DD/YYYY 
or MM-DD (defaulting to the next upcoming date. i.e. If you enter 01/01 it should default to 01/01/2023). 
When it’s not either of the formats it should provide an error message and accept the next input. [DONE]
-----------
allow user to change today’s date, for example to allow simulating calculation of any two future dates 
such as 12/21/2022 and 7/4/2025 
-----------
use a while loop to read in user input until there’s no input. Do not write code that opens files, 
you will run your Java program using file redirection instead to mimic user input. 
-----------
write comments in your code such that a student from CISC 1115 can figure out where to update your 
code so that your program can also allow input of type YYYY-MM-DD and/or print output to a text file.
